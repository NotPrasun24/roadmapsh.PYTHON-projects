                Since starting my career in 2021,
                 I have only followed one resource, roadmap.sh, it truly helped me go from 
                 0 to having a job and changing the financial trajectory of my family.

        <p> roadmap.sh is an increadible reasource. I was fortunate to discover it during my university days in 2018. Back then, it was just a single repository with three images. It's amazing to see how much impact it has had on millions of lives since then.</p>
